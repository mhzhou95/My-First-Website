		<p><span style="color: white"> I was born in China but moved to the United States when i was four years old. That made me start school in the states so my english is actually better than my chinese. I used to live in Brooklyn, New York. Before middle school started i moved to Philadelphia. Attended Central High School and attempted higher education at temple university but didn't finish. Some of my hobbies are playing online games on pc and mobile. I watch t.v. shows too but only recomended ones. During my free time i read novels. These novels are chinese novels but because i cant read chinese they are translated ones. I love hanging out and parties so if you send me a invite there is a high chance i will show up.</span></p>
